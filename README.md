## Description

Hello world! I'm Claudio Martin and here i present you a template that can help developing for newcomers.
This project provides a well-structured Node.js backend template employing Express and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. It offers a solid foundation for building secure and scalable RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **Express Framework**: Utilizes Express for efficient routing, middleware handling, and server management.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JWT for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Modular Structure**: Encourages organized code with potential separation for controllers, models, and services (depending on project complexity).
- **Testing**: Supports unit testing with Vitest (or your preferred testing framework).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed. Verify with:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v  # or yarn -v
  ```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-template-martinherranzc.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend-template-martinherranzc
npm install  # or yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. This file holds sensitive information, such as your JWT secret key. You can use a library like `dotenv` to access these variables. Example:

```plaintext
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
# Other environment variables (e.g., database connection details)
```

> **Important**: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. Configure your IDE to ignore this file.

### Start the Server

```bash
npm start  # or yarn start
```

This will start the server, typically listening on port 3000 (default for Express). Check your terminal logs to confirm the server is running.

## Usage (Example)

### User Registration

- Create an API endpoint (usually a POST request) to handle user registration.
- Upon successful registration, generate a JWT token using the `jsonwebtoken` library and the secret key from your `.env` file.
- Send the JWT token back to the client in the response.

### User Login

- Create a login endpoint.
- Validate user credentials against your data store (e.g., a database).
- If valid, generate a JWT token as in registration.

### Protected Endpoints

- Use middleware (e.g., `express-jwt`) to protect routes that require authentication.
- Decode the JWT token from the client's request headers to verify user identity and authorization.

## Running Tests

### Test Configuration

Refer to the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for setup and test writing guidelines. Place test files in a `__tests__` directory and use Vitest syntax.

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test  # or yarn test
```

## Development

Feel free to customize the project structure and add features as needed. Consider adding error handling, logging, and database integration for a fully functional backend API.

## Additional Notes

- Replace `your_strong_jwt_secret_key` in the `.env` example with a long, random, and cryptographically secure key for production use.
- Securely store your JWT secret key and other sensitive information.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration details.
- This template is adaptable, so explore best practices for secure and robust RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.
